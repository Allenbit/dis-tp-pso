# Project: Evolving a “following and chain-building” behavior using PSO

Using PSO, optimize a robot-following and chain-creation behavior for the real e-puck
platform. The goal is to create a long chain of robots. First, in Webots, develop a
Braitenberg type algorithm and implement your learning strategy. Then, implement
your optimized behavior on the real platform using 4 e-puck robots (1 leader, 3
followers). Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and identify possible
changes to the heuristics which might improve the transition from the simulated e-puck
to the real one.
