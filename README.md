# Project: Evolving a “following and chain-building” behavior using PSO

Using PSO, optimize a robot-following and chain-creation behavior for the real e-puck
platform. The goal is to create a long chain of robots. First, in Webots, develop a
Braitenberg type algorithm and implement your learning strategy. Then, implement
your optimized behavior on the real platform using 4 e-puck robots (1 leader, 3
followers). Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and identify possible
changes to the heuristics which might improve the transition from the simulated e-puck
to the real one.

## Topics and Goals

### Prequisits and Design

* design PSO
* design fitness function
* design neural network controller (braitenberg controller)
* do nonlinear sensor calibration with epuck

### Implementation Webots

* setup environement and trajectory
* implement fitness function
* implement PSO

### Optimization in Webots

* run PSO
* run PSO with noise

### Implementation Epuck

* implement lookup table for sensor values
* implement braitenberg values

### Optional Optimization

* noiseresistant PSO
* PID controller
