\section{INTRODUCTION}
The goal of this project is to implement a Braitenberg-type controller for movement in formation on e-pucks. For this, a PSO algorithm was implemented, using the weights of the Braitenberg-type controller as a search space. The formation consists of 3 follower robots and one leader that moves with a predefined trajectory. The PSO is run on the Webots platform, which is capable of simulating the behavior of the e-pucks in a realistic way. This makes it possible to run the algorithm and get results much faster than doing it on real e-pucks.

\subsection{Design of PSO}
In order to design a PSO algorithm for a collaborative task, we had to consider three axes: The diversity of the team, the performance evaluation and the solution sharing. We decided  to use a heterogeneous approach with individual performance evaluation and group solution sharing. The idea is to evaluate different solutions on the three followers (heterogenous approach) in order to save computation time and to share the pool of solutions (group solution) to have evolution of the particles. Since we are interested in the performance of each follower with its own particle and not in the performance of the entire chain we need an individual performance evaluation.


\subsection{Design of Fitness Function}
The idea of the fitness function is to evaluate the performance of a controller in being able to follow a leader and stay in chain formation. The design of the fitness function is of primary importance because it defines towards which solution the PSO will converge. Four characteristics were found to be important to evaluate following and chain-building behavior:
\begin{itemize}
\item The range $d$, which is the distance between the follower and the leader, has to be minimized.
\item The relative heading of leader and follower $\Delta \phi $. The heading is defined as the angular orientation of the robot in a fixed frame of reference. The relative heading is zero, when both robots are facing the same way. This angle has to be minimized in order to have nice following. 
\item The bearing $\theta $, which is the angular offset of the leader's position with respect to the heading of the follower. This quantity has to be minimized so that the follower always stays behind the leader.
\item The relative speed between leader and follower $\Delta v $ can be minimized in order to have a smoother following behavior. This was part of our original design but has later been proven unnecessary.
\end{itemize}
The fitness function has to be maximized. We define it as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{fitness}
F=\frac{1}{A*d+B*\theta+C*\Delta \phi+C* \Delta v}
\end{equation}
Where A,B,C,D are coefficients of importance of the different components that are initially set to one and have to be determined.

\subsection{Implementation on Webots}

\subsubsection{Environment}
The Webots environment used to simulate the following and chain building consists of one leader e-puck and three followers on a smooth ground free of walls or any obstacles. They followers are initially placed in line behind the leader with a distance of 10 cm between their centres and facing the same way. A supervisor, which is a special kind of robot with more functions, is used to run the PSO algorithm, track the position of the robots, communicate with them and reset their position.

\subsubsection{Supervisor}
The role of the supervisor is to set the initial settings and then to run the PSO. In short, it sends the particles to the followers for their evaluation, gets their fitness back, evolves the swarm and restarts an iteration. After running one full PSO, it uses the best results for the next one and so on until results are satisfying.\\
The number of particles in the swarm is set higher than the number of followers. Since the approach is heterogeneous, the supervisor evaluates them in batches of three by sending one particle (i.e. one set of weights for their Braitenberg controller) to each follower. Then comes the evaluation period during which the followers evaluate the fitness of the controller. To evaluate the fitness of its run according to equation \ref{fitness}, the follower needs to know its coordinates and those of the robot it is following. Thus, while the followers are doing their evaluation run, the supervisor sends to the followers their spatial coordinates (translation and roatation) and those of their respective leader. Once the fitness of each particles is evaluated, it is returned to the supervisor and stored. The supervisor resets the followers and the leader in their initial position and replicates the previous procedure with the following batch of particles. Once all the particles of the swarm have been evaluated, they evolve according to the PSO algorithm using the fitness values obtained for each particle. The new swarm obtained is evaluated  and evolved in the same way as the previous swarm. The number of these evolution iterations is set beforehand.\\
When the last iteration is over, the weights of the particle that returned the best fitness during this run of the PSO are tested by sending them to the followers a chosen number of times and measuring the average fitness of the solution. If the results are better than the previous best, the solution is stored in a text file and set as initial weights for the next PSO run. The entire PSO algorithm is run again like the previous one, each particle being initialized with the best weights so far. This higher level of iterations is run as long as needed to get satisfying results. The weights that had the best fitness evaluation can be extracted from the text file and implemented on the real epucks.\\
The supervisor also communicates in a unilateral way with the leader, sending an interruption message every time the positions are reset. The purpose of this is that the leader restarts its trajectory, so as to have always the same trajectory in the case of predefined ones. This was needed at the beginning of the evolutions in order to have all the particles evaluated on a trajectory having the same level of difficulty. This way, weights that are worse than others cannot have a better fitness evaluation just because the trajectory was easier, which would be counter productive.

\subsubsection{Follower}
There are three followers having the same code. The role of a follower is to evaluate the fitness of the particle that is sent by the supervisor. The weights received are used for their Braitenberg-type controller and the fitness is evaluated using \ref{fitness} before being sent back to the supervisor.
\paragraph{Braitenberg-type controller}
The Braitenberg-type controller is a simple neural network consisting of two neurons corresponding to the wheel motors of the e-puck. As input nodes, the neural network uses the infra-red sensors of the e-puck  and a bias. The outputs are the motor commands of the two wheels. The outputs are also cross-coupled and fed back to their neuron. The complexity of the controller is reduced using symmetry. Indeed, the same weights can be used for the bias, cross-coupling and auto-coupling of both nodes and the weights corresponding to the opposite sensors can be used for the neuron corresponding to the opposite wheel. Moreover, the back sensors can be ignored as they do not play a role in a following behavior. Thus, the number of weights of the controller is reduced to nine: six for the infra-red sensors, one for the bias, one for the cross coupling and one for the auto-coupling.
