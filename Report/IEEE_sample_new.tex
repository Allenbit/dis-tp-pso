\section{INTRODUCTION}
The goal of this project is to implement a braitenberg-type controller for movement in
formation on epucks. For this, a PSO algorithm was implemented, using the braitenberg weights as a search space.

                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
